# Theremin Research Summary

## How a Theremin Works and Its Sound Characteristics

### Physical Principles
- The theremin is an electronic instrument that generates sound through electromagnetic fields
- It uses two metal antennas that create electromagnetic fields:
  - A vertical antenna controls pitch
  - A horizontal antenna controls volume
- Contains three radio-frequency oscillators (two for pitch, one for volume)
- Sound is produced by variations in capacitance when a player's hands move near the antennas
- The human body acts as a capacitor, interacting with the instrument's electromagnetic field
- As the player's hand moves closer or further from the antenna, it changes the capacitance of the circuit
- This capacitance change modulates the alternating current, generating different pitches and volumes
- The process involves heterodyning (mixing) of radio-frequency oscillators

### Sound Characteristics
- Distinctive timbre described as a cross between a violin and a soprano voice
- Ethereal, eerie, haunting and beautiful sound quality
- Almost vocal-like quality with a strange electronic tone
- Features a gliding, portamento-like quality (smooth sliding between notes)
- Sound is generated without physical contact with the instrument

### Frequency Range and Timbre
- Most theremins have a wide frequency range spanning approximately six octaves
- Actual playable audio range is approximately 65 Hz to 3 kHz
- Moog's Etherwave Theremin specifically provides an accurate five-octave pitch range
- Not a pure tone - the harmonic timbre is an important feature of the instrument
- The sound is generated by mixing oscillators at supersonic frequencies (typically around 350 kHz)
- The original design intentionally created a complex, non-pure sound output

## Web Audio API Theremin Implementation

### Key Web Audio API Components
1. **AudioContext**: The foundation for all Web Audio API operations
2. **OscillatorNode**: Generates the base sound waves
3. **GainNode**: Controls volume and sound dynamics
4. **Event Listeners**: Track user interaction (mouse/touch position)
5. **HTML5 Canvas**: Optional for visual representation of audio

### Implementation Approaches for Position Mapping

#### Mouse/Touch Position Mapping
- **Vertical Position (Y-axis)**: Typically mapped to frequency/pitch
  - Lower position = lower frequency
  - Higher position = higher frequency
- **Horizontal Position (X-axis)**: Often mapped to volume/gain
  - Left position = lower volume
  - Right position = higher volume

#### Code Implementation Pattern
1. Create an AudioContext
2. Generate an oscillator node
3. Set up frequency and waveform controls
4. Connect nodes for sound generation
5. Add event listeners to track mouse/touch movement
6. Map position coordinates to audio parameters

### Examples and Libraries

#### Notable Examples
- "Violent Theremin" (MDN): Browser-based theremin using Web Audio API and HTML5 canvas
- "Theremin" by nfriend: Uses Web Audio API with Leap Motion controller
- "Theremix": A progressive web app for theremin interaction
- "Veremin": A video-based theremin using PoseNet for motion tracking

## Implementation Considerations

### Sound Quality Enhancement
- Consider using multiple oscillators to create richer harmonics
- Add subtle vibrato to mimic the natural hand tremor of theremin players
- Implement low-pass filters to shape the tone

### User Experience
- Provide visual feedback for hand/cursor position
- Consider calibration options for different screen sizes
- Implement touch support for mobile devices

### Advanced Features
- Add different waveform options (sine, square, sawtooth)
- Implement reverb or delay effects for a more atmospheric sound
- Consider using machine learning for gesture recognition (like face tracking or hand tracking APIs)
